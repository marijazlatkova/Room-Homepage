## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- React
- Sass
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I reinforced my understanding of responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox. I also improved my skills in implementing interactive components like sliders that work well across devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Continued development

For future projects, I plan to further refine my skills in animation for smooth transitions and continue exploring more advanced features of CSS Grid and Flexbox. Additionally, I aim to delve deeper into JavaScript for creating more interactive elements.
